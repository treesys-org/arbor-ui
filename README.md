# 🌳 Arbor UI

**The Visual Browser for Decentralized Knowledge.**

This is the **Frontend** repository for Arbor. It acts as a "player" or "browser" that visualizes knowledge trees. It is a serverless, zoneless, vanilla JS application.

## 🔗 Official Knowledge Source

By default, this application connects to the official **Arbor Knowledge** repository:

👉 **[github.com/treesys-org/arbor-knowledge](https://github.com/treesys-org/arbor-knowledge)**

The UI loads the `data.json` file generated by that repository.

## ✨ Features

*   **Visual Exploration:** Navigate complex topics like an interactive mind map.
*   **Decentralized:** Can load any external "Tree" (JSON file) via URL.
*   **Zero Build:** Runs 100% in the browser (Vanilla JS + Tailwind via CDN).
*   **Open Source:** GPL-3.0 License.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
    *   *Note: For better performance and to avoid CORS issues with local files, it is recommended to use a simple local server like `python -m http.server` or the Live Server extension in VS Code.*
3.  The app will automatically fetch the latest content from the cloud (Arbor Knowledge).

## 🛠️ Development

This project uses no build tools (No Webpack, No Vite, No Angular CLI). It uses native ES Modules.

*   **`src/`**: Contains the application logic (Store, Components, Services).
*   **`index.html`**: The main entry point.
